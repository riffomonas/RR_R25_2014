# Research Strategy
## Significance
The NIH-funded Human Microbiome Project (HMP) Roadmap Initiative engendered
great enthusiasm in understanding how the structure and function of the
microbiome relates to human health {The Human Microbiome Consortium, 2012
#2616;The Human Microbiome Consortium, 2012 #2617}. This initiative has resulted
in a expansion of support at the NIH, who now supports these research efforts
across 27 institutes, centers, and offices. The funding for microbiome research
more than doubled between fiscal years 2010 and 2012 to a total of more than
$180 million for nearly 300 grants and contracts (Lita Proctor, NHGRI, personal
communication). This financial support, combined with the development of next
generation sequencing platforms resulted in a meteoric rise in
microbiome-related publications (see Fig. 1). This massive expansion in
microbiome research has relied on biomedical researchers to do their own
bioinformatics leading to a common complaint that researchers are either unaware
of or underserved by existing tools {Mardis, 2010 #1;Gevers, 2012 #2711}. The
experience across the microbiome research domain has largely paralleled that of
other biomedical research areas were, as the RFA for this competition notes,
"graduate students were often significantly dependent on the mentor or the
mentor's lab for the training received, and postdoctoral fellows were primarily
dependent on the mentor or mentor's lab at all institutions.  Rather than
being learned in prescribed curricula, **training in good laboratory practices
that influence data reproducibility appears to be largely passed down from
generation to generation of working scientists**, with substantial variation
from laboratory to laboratory." It is clear that microbiome research is an
important part of the NIH portfolio and that there is a dearth of training for
its practitioners in the development of best practices related to insuring
reproducibility of methods. The contribution of the proposed project will
provide this growing community of researchers the tools they need to improve the
reproducibility of their research. ***This will yield a significant vertical step
in the field because we will have greater confidence in the results and we are
better enabled to use previous studies as a launch point for further
investigations.*** The support of this project will yield multiple benefits to
NIH-funded projects and beyond. First, although the current proposal focuses on
microbiome research, it is reasonable to expect that with some customization,
the materials could be easily tailored to other disciplines where novice
practitioners are implementign their own bioinformatic analyses. Second,
microbiome research is a specialized form of microbial ecology. Other microbial
ecologists who study environments as diverse as hydrothermal vents and soil
{Lesniewski, 2012 #2732;Schloss, 2006 #992} will benefit from the training they
can receive through the proposed instructional materials.


## Innovation
Our research group has been at the forefront of microbiome research through our
development of the popular software package, mothur, which has now been cited
more than 2,200 times, making it the most widely cited software package for
analyzing microbiome data [refs]. Through our development of mothur, we have
engaged thousands of researchers through a wiki, forum, and mailing list that
support mothur and through face-to-face workshops held at conferences,
universities, and as part of larger training initiatives. We recently conducted
a survey that was advertised through our newsletter and received 170 responses.
First, 41% of users were graduate students, 41% were PhD-level scientists, and
12% were faculty. Second, 48% of the respondents have used mothur within
Windows, 32% within Mac OS X, and 45% within Linux. Finally and perhaps most
surprising, 41% have no programming background. The others reported knowing R
(35%), Perl (32%), Python (27%), C/C++ (16%), Java (10%), or some other language
(10%).  These results and our experiences emphasize the that most individuals
carrying out microbiome research have limited experience in performing
bioinformatics research and are largely self-taught. In fact, from these
experiences, we have met the graduate students, postdocs, and faculty that the
quote from the RFA above describes and know that we are in a unique position to
engage this community. Although there are some exceptions, the *status quo* has
generally involved incomplete methods descriptions that are frequently at odds
with the papers being referenced and the use of "in house" scripts and pipelines
that are not disseminated with the final manuscript. ***Therefore, the proposed
research is innovative, in our opinion, because it will fulfil and unmet need to
develop instructional materials to train the growing number of microbiome
researchers best practices and insure that their analyses are reproducible by
others.*** Once it is possible to confidently reproduce analyses it will be
possible to move on to determining whether the analyses were done well and to
build off of previous analyses to expand our knowledge of how the microbiome
affects transitions between health and disease.


## Proposed Research Education Program.
While the proposed research education program may complement ongoing research
training and education occurring at the applicant institution, the proposed
educational experiences must be distinct from those research training and
research education programs currently receiving federal support. When research
training programs are on-going in the same department, the applicant
organization should clearly distinguish between the activities in the proposed
research education program and the research training supported by the training
program. The description should include the educational and/or career level(s)
of the planned participants. The research education proposed must be targeted to
graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and beginning investigators

It is expected that the proposed training modules will identify deficiencies and
teach best laboratory practices in one or more of the following four general
areas:

* Analysis and reporting: what are the necessary procedural details that should
be included; what are the research resources that must be identified, including
their type and source

* Culture of science: how to ensure adequate oversight when the volume and speed
of new science may mean mentors are unfamiliar with technology used by their
trainees.

State the goals for education and justify the area of training selected for
module development in terms of its relevance and potential impact on improving
data reproducibility. Describe the subject material to be covered.  Describe the
format for the training module proposed and justify it in terms of the education
goals.  The length of the proposed training module should be explained in terms
of scope and depth of coverage of the subject matter and how the research
education will be utilized by trainees, for example, a module on how to avoid
confirmation bias to be taken by all beginning laboratory workers at the
graduate student, postdoctoral fellow and beginning investigator level, or a
module on appropriate design of animal studies to be taken immediately prior to
beginning such work. Describe the plans for piloting the training module.


The over-arching goal of this NIH R25 program is to support educational
activities that complement and/or enhance the training of a workforce to meet
the nation’s biomedical, behavioral and clinical research needs and foster a
better understanding of biomedical, behavioral and clinical research and its
implications. To accomplish the stated over-arching goal, this FOA will support
creative educational activities with a primary focus on **exportable training
modules designed to enhance data reproducibility, targeted to graduate students,
postdoctoral fellows, and beginning investigators.**


## Principal Investigator
As indicated by his biosketch and the numerous letters of support, Schloss is a
respected member of the microbiome research community and is an excellent
teacher that is anxious to utilize innovative teaching methods to communicate
complex materials. Over the past 6 years, Schloss has been the PI on 9 research
grants funded by NIH and other agencies including 2 R01 projects related to the
microibome. He has served as a co-Investigator on 7 additional projects during
that time. From this funding he has published 32 peer-reviewed publications and
he was the senior author on 16 of these studies; all of these studies have
involved research questions related to the microbiome. At the University of
Michigan, Schloss has developed two courses: *Symbiosis* and *Microbial
informatics*. The latter is a course that is designed to teach microbiology MS
and PhD students and postdocs to use R. This semester, in preparation for this
proposal, Schloss successfully experimented with using knitr-based documents and
GitHub repositories to submit assignments. In addition, all of his course
materials have been made available through the course's GitHub site including
the lecture slides that were prepared using the R slidify package that is based
on the knitr package (microbialinformatics.github.io). Although this course
touches on the content of the proposed teaching mateirals, it focused on
developing R skills rather than laboratory practices. This couse and Schloss's
willingness to experiment with the content is indicative of his innovative
approach to teaching. Finally, over the past 7 years, Schloss has offered 4-5
workshops describing how microbiologists can use mothur and R to analyze data
from microbiome research projects. This experience has given him a unique
perspective into the needs and competencies of the microbiome resarch community.
Together, these data and experiences indicate Schloss is "actively engaged in
research in an area related to the mission of NIH, and can organize, administer,
monitor, and evaluate the research education program."


## Program Faculty
Schloss will be the primary Program Faculty member for this project. In
addition, we have received numerous letters of support from colleagues at the
University of Michigan and across the United States indicating their support for
this project. In addition, each has responded enthusiastically to their
willingness to have us test our initial instructional materials with them and
their research groups. These colleagues represent a diverse array of individuals
with varying research interests (alphabetical):

* Jim Cavalcoli, PhD: University of Michigan
* Claire Fraser, PhD: University of Maryland
* Elizabeth Grice, PhD: University of Pennsylvania
* Jo Handelsman, PhD: Yale University
* Gary Huffnagle, PhD: University of Michigan
* John LiPuma, MD: University of Michigan
* Harry Mobley, PhD: University of Michigan
* Eric Pamer, MD: Memorial Sloan-Ketterin Cancer Center
* Courtney Robinson, PhD: Howard University
* Julie Segre, PhD: National Human Genetics Research Institute
* Vincent Young, MD/PhD: University of Michigan


## Program Participants
The target audiences for these modules are graduate students, postdoctoral
fellows, junior faculty, and more senior investigators that lead research
groups. Although we anticipate that any researcher will gain something from the
materials, our  primary audience is the growing pool of researchers that are new
to microbiome research and have limited computational skills. For this audience,
we will have an entry level stage where they would go through all of the
modules. An innovative component of our project will provide training materials
for those leading research groups to help them understand how to interact with
those researchers that they supervise. Two significant problems with a lack of
reproducibility include the inability of supervisors to adequately vet a
trainees methods and the inability of supervisors to fully engage with the
trainee in develop the methods. By including participants from across multiple
levels we will be able to take a more holistic approach to the problem of
reproducible research within the microbiome research area.

We pride ourselves on recruiting diverse cohorts of researchers to the workshops
we hold to instruct people on best practices for using mothur to analyze 16S
rRNA gene sequences. It is common for the number of women to outnumber men and
to have 4-5 African American and Hispanic American researchers attend workshop
with 30 participants. This level of diversity is uncommon in computational
workshops. Our strategy is to place a very low bar for admission to the
workshops, requiring that the researcher merely email us to register. We have
identified a number of research groups led by diverse investigators that we will
use to help develop and refine our materials prior to final dissemination.
Included in these is the research group of Dr. Courtney Robinson, an Assistant
Professor at Howard University, which is a Historically Black University. For
all of our assessments we will keep track of the researchers' gender, race,
ethnicity, and academic rank to understand whether there are individual groups
that we are not accessing or that may be having greater difficulties with some
materials than other groups. Finally, because the materials will be made freely
available to anyone that wants to participate in the modules, there should be
little difficulty in maintaining a high level of diversity among the
participants. Regardless, we will continue to monitor the demographic
distribution of the participants on the pre-test. We are committed to making
our materials accessible to anyone wanting to engage them. Our track record with
previous training efforts indicates that our approach does an exceptional job of
engaging a diverse cross section of microbiologists.

We take seriously our commitment to maintaining a low barrier to participation
in our training modules. This includes insuring that the proposed training
modules are compliant with section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. '794
d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (P.L. 105–220). To
achieve this, we will follow the recommendations provided at the "GSA 508
Tutorials, Guidance, Checklists" website
(http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/103565).  



## Institutional Environment and Commitment
Schloss has secured institutional support for this project on multiple levels.
First, as indicated by the letter of support from Dr. Harry L.T. Mobley, Chair
of the Department of Microbiology & Immunology at the University of Michigan
School of Medicine, Schloss has the support of the university to gain access to
adequate staff, facilities, and educational resources to make the planned
research education program successful. Second, Schloss has interacted with the
Center for Research on Learning and Teaching (CRLT) at the University of
Michigan to plan the assessment program for this project (see letter of support
from Smith). The CRLT provides a mixture of complimentary and fee-based
services, but does not participate in projects as personnel on grant proposals.
The support provided by CRLT will insure that Schloss it utilizing the latest in
pedagogical theory and assessment to develop the proposed teaching modules.
Third, the letter of support from Dr. Mary O'Riordan, Director of the University
of Michigan Program in Biomedical Sciences (PIBS), Schloss has her support to
solicit incoming graduate students to help develop and assess the instructional
materials that he develops for this project. Fourth, as indicated by the
numerous letters of support from other microbiome researchers at the University
of Michigan and across the United States, Schloss has the support and commitment
of other investigators to implement this project. They all see the value of
developing instructional materials such as those described in this proposal.
Finally, at the national level, Schloss has secured the support and commitment
of the American Society of Microbiology. Their letter of support indicates that
they would be receptive of Schloss presenting his teaching materials in
workshops at the annual General Meeting and that they would be willing to help
advertise the materials in their publications. The multiple levels of commitment
and broad support that this proposal enjoys speaks to its importance and the
unique qualifications of Schloss to lead the project.


## Evaluation Plan
Applications must include a plan for evaluating the activities supported by the
award in terms of their frequency of use and their usefulness. The application
must specify baseline metrics (e.g., numbers, educational levels, and
demographic characteristics of participants), as well as measures to gauge the
short or long-term success of the research education award in achieving its
objectives. Wherever appropriate, applicants are encouraged to obtain feedback
from participants to help identify weaknesses and to provide suggestions for
improvements.


## Dissemination Plan
We hope that this project will be a seed to engage other developers and the
microbiome community, in general, improve the reproducibility of microbiome
research. All instructional materials will be made freely available through a
website at www.retromonas.org. To disseminate these materials we will several
avenues. We will:  

* Utilize social media (e.g. Twitter and blogs) to promote a reproducible
microbiome research initiative. This will create enthusiasm in the microbiome
community and foster their interest in developing and improving the modules.
* Publish at least two manuscripts describing the issue of
reproducibility in microbiome research and the development of our teaching
modules.
* Exploit several microbiome-based e-mailing lists that Schloss (PI) is part of
including the extensive mothur mailing list (N=XXXX users) and the Human
Microbiome Project XXXXX mailing list (N=XXXX users).
* Network with other microbiome researchers (see letters of support) to
facilitate workshops at 3 universities each of the two years of  the project.
This will serve ot help us develop the modules as well as  disseminate the
modules.
* Utilize our connections within the American Society for Microbiology
to advertise advertise the module through *Microbe* magazine and in workshop
offerings at the society's General Meetings in 2016 and 2017 (see letter of
support from ASM).


In addition to a website that hosts information about the instructional
materials, we intend to continue to develop instructional materials and best
practices beyond the funded period of this project to foster greater
reproducibility in microbiome research. Once funding for this project has been
exhausted, the project should be able to continue on as a democratic, open
source, community-supported endeavor. To support this all materials related
to the project will be maintained as a public GitHub project repository
(http://www.github/retromonas). In fact, the development of this proposal is
available at http://www.github/retromonas/reproduciblity_R25.


## Timeline
Provide a timeline for module development, piloting and refinement,
dissemination, evaluation, and maintenance.  This timeline must propose making
the training publicly available within two years of the award date
